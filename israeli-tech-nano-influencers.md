5. **@calcalistech (3,800 followers)** - Tech journalism, ecosystem news

### Engagement Approach:
- **Hebrew Content**: Many profiles engage in both Hebrew and English - consider bilingual engagement strategy
- **Community Focus**: Israeli tech ecosystem is tight-knit with strong IDF unit connections (especially Unit 8200)
- **Topics**: Cybersecurity, startup culture, developer tools, product management, women in tech
- **Timing**: Consider Israeli time zone (UTC+2/+3) for optimal engagement
- **Events**: Reversim Summit, Java.IL meetups, TechAviv events are key gathering points

### Content Themes to Engage With:

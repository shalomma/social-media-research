# Israeli Tech Nano-Influencers - Research Metadata

*Last Updated: October 24, 2025*

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: Track nano-influencers (<10K followers) in the Israeli tech ecosystem for strategic engagement purposes
**Target Audience**: Developers, founders, product managers, tech journalists, and community builders
**Geographic Focus**: Israel (primarily Tel Aviv, Jerusalem)
**Current Status**: Initial research phase completed with 20+ qualified profiles identified

---

## Discovery Methodology

### Search Strategy Employed:
1. Web search for Israeli tech Twitter lists and curated communities
2. Analysis of Israeli tech conferences and meetup organizers (Reversim Summit, Java.IL, etc.)
3. Investigation of Israeli tech publications and their journalists
4. Research into Unit 8200 alumni networks and developer communities
5. Identification of women in tech initiatives and founders
6. Analysis of Israeli tech podcasters and content creators

### Verification Limitations:
- Follower counts are based on search results and may require direct verification
- Some profiles marked as "Pending Verification" need real-time Twitter access for confirmation
- Activity levels should be verified directly on Twitter/X before engagement

## Search History

### October 24, 2025 - Initial Discovery Session

**Searches Conducted:**
1. General Israeli tech nano-influencers + Hebrew keywords
2. Israeli startup founders and developers on Twitter
3. Tel Aviv tech community and ecosystem accounts
4. Twitter lists (discovered @aleph/Tech Influencers - Israel list)
5. IDF Unit 8200 alumni in tech
6. Specific individuals (Hillel Fuld - 189.6K followers, too large)
7. Reversim Summit community and speakers
8. Israeli women in tech founders and developers
9. Tel Aviv tech meetup organizers
10. Israeli tech journalists and publications
11. Israeli tech podcasters
12. Developer community accounts
13. Cybersecurity experts
14. AI/ML developers
15. Product managers

**Key Findings:**
- Verified nano-influencers: @Naama_Cohen (107), @calcalistech (3,800), Bootstrap (125), Builders of Jerusalem (178), Reversim (1,600)
- Community accounts often have engaged individual members worth connecting with
- Israeli tech ecosystem is highly interconnected through IDF units, especially Unit 8200
- Strong bilingual presence (Hebrew/English) across most profiles
- Women in tech initiatives are growing but still underrepresented (~10% founders)
- Tel Aviv dominates but Jerusalem has distinct startup community

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Twitter/X lists require JavaScript and don't render in web searches
- Many search results focused on larger influencers (>10K followers)
- Difficult to verify follower counts without direct Twitter access
- Some promising leads lack clear Twitter handles in search results
- Political content often mixed with tech content in search results

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Verify follower counts for pending profiles using direct Twitter access
2. Search individual CTech journalist profiles
3. Mine Reversim Summit speaker archives for individual developers
4. Check Monday.com, Wix, and other major Israeli companies for developer advocates
5. Search for Israeli product management communities
6. Investigate TechAviv and Startup Grind Tel Aviv organizers
7. Look for Hebrew-language tech podcasters
8. Search for Israeli tech YouTubers who cross-post to Twitter

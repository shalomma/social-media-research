# Israeli Tech Nano-Influencers - Research Metadata

*Last Updated: October 25, 2025*

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: Track nano-influencers (<10K followers) in the Israeli tech ecosystem for strategic engagement purposes
**Target Audience**: Developers, founders, product managers, tech journalists, and community builders
**Geographic Focus**: Israel (primarily Tel Aviv, Jerusalem)
**Current Status**: Initial research phase completed with 20+ qualified profiles identified

---

## Discovery Methodology

### Search Strategy Employed:
1. Web search for Israeli tech Twitter lists and curated communities
2. Analysis of Israeli tech conferences and meetup organizers (Reversim Summit, Java.IL, etc.)
3. Investigation of Israeli tech publications and their journalists
4. Research into Unit 8200 alumni networks and developer communities
5. Identification of women in tech initiatives and founders
6. Analysis of Israeli tech podcasters and content creators

### Verification Limitations:
- Follower counts are based on search results and may require direct verification
- Some profiles marked as "Pending Verification" need real-time Twitter access for confirmation
- Activity levels should be verified directly on Twitter/X before engagement
